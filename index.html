Complete Tree Service in Colorado Springs specializes in tree removals from your residential or commercial property and we are experienced in all sizes of trees. No two tree removals are the same so our tree experts will inspect the jobsite for hazards, determine how much rigging equipment will be required and if crane assistance is needed. The trees stability, age and proximity to structures and whether it's near any electrical lines are all considerations that need to be taken into account when analyzing a tree removal. Complete Tree Service has experience in tree cutting when a tree is close to a structure or in an area that is difficult to reach. We will talk with you about the safest method for removing your tree and give you a free written estimate for the cost of the tree removal on your property.</p>
<p class="text-left small">
If you have a large dead tree or large tree limbs that need to be removed we specialize in those kind of removals. In the event of a removal, our skilled climbers have all of the necessary equipment to ensure that your removal is done safely and without property damage. We will ensure that your property is left clean upon completion of the job. We handle the haul away of the debris from the tree removal and if you'd like we can leave the wood for you to split. For your convenience, budget and consideration, Complete Tree Service will give you several options for your tree removal needs.</p>

                        <p>Pruning is the most common tree maintenance procedure. Although forest trees grow quite well with only natureâ€™s pruning, landscape trees require a higher level of care to maintain their safety and aesthetics. Pruning should be done with an understanding of how the tree responds to each cut. Improper pruning can cause damage that will last for the life of the tree, or worse, shorten the treeâ€™s life.</p>

Using top of the line equipment we can remove any stump from anywhere on your residential or commercial property.</p>
                        <p>With a variety of machines that are made for stump grinding effectively, we can handle even the most stubborn stumps. If you have an extremely large sized stump or one that is located on a hill or a stump that is in a narrow opening we will handle it. We can leave the wood chips piled up from the tree stump for you to re-use as mulch, or haul them away.</p>
                        <p> Beaver Brook Tree Service will work with you to understand your long and short term plans for the area and will give you recommended options. Our customers intention for the new yard opening where the stump is removed will determine the specifications regarding how the stump will be removed. This will include how wide and deep to grind the tree stump roots. If a customer intends to re-plant another tree then the tree stump roots will need to be completely removed.</p>
